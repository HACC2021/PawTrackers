## Project Story
### About the Project
#### Elevator Pitch
Helping pet owners reconnect with their pets as efficiently as possible and communicate with the HNL Airport Animal Quarantine staff through a user-friendly site. 


#### Inspiration
Reuniting pet owners with their _"paw-hana"_ is our utmost priority. In light of this pandemic, we would like to help the Department of Agriculture effectively communicate with pet owners. Pet owners now have the time to grab a bite, enjoy the shade, and have the reassurance that their pets are in great ~~paws~~ hands!


#### What it does
Our website prepares passengers for their pet's arrival, provides document uploading, monitors pet's status, and helps pet owners communicate directly with Animal Quarantine staff. 

The Animal Quarantine staff anticipate incoming flights and passengers, verify documents, and process each pet as quickly and safely as possible.


#### How we built it
We built our web application using `bootstrap` with native `html`, `css`, and `javascript`. 


#### Challenges we ran into
A lack of resources was the largest challenge we faced. Having a small team translated to a large workload and difficulty with scheduling. By concentrating on incremental validation the application was developed regardless of conflicting priorities.


#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The balance of the _simplicity_ of our design and depth of our features. The website interacts dynamically with the user to provide an easy experience. Aligning trip information with pickup time provides a lot of convenience so that the user can easily plan ahead. 


#### What we learned
This competition is our team's first experience with `bootstrap` web development. We learned the fundamentals and techniques to implement functionality with aesthetic design. 


#### What's next for Paw Trackers
Paw Trackers seeks to find more opportunities to help our community using the skills we have developed throughout this competition.

## Additional Info
### Security/Privacy Proposal
To ensure user security, we plan to conduct static and dynamic code analysis to eliminate bugs. Reducing the number of bugs throughout our code makes our overall system less vulnerable to hackers. Users will be guaranteed proper access control through password policy enforcement. The information collected from users would pass through a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) tunnel with encryption. This encrypted data will be subject to disk encryption. An application such as Microsoft Bitlocker can run and encrypt the data stored. Finally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) framework to verify the security of the overall system.
