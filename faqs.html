                                        <a id="q1" name="q1"></a><strong>1. Why does Hawaii have a quarantine for dogs, cats and carnivores?<a href="faqs.html">back to top</a></strong></p>
                                    <p>Hawaii is the only state that is rabies-free. It is important that we maintain that status. The introduction of rabies would have dire circumstances, not only for public health, but would have an adverse affect on Hawaii’s
                                        unique eco-system, tourism, as well as local lifestyle.</p>
                                    <p>Because Hawaii is rabies free, resident pets are not required to be vaccinated for rabies. Should rabies become established in the state, animal and human health programs and rabies disease control programs would be
                                        very costly for the citizens of the entire state.</p>
                                    <p>To prevent rabies from entering the state, the current law requires that dogs, cats and carnivores complete either the 120-day or 5 Day Or Less rabies quarantine. The law also requires that entire cost of the rabies
                                        quarantine program be paid by the users of the quarantine facility. General funds (taxpayer funds) may not be used to run this program.</p>

                                    <p>The 120-day quarantine program costs $1,080 per pet.<br> The 5 Day Or Less quarantine program costs $244 per pet.<br> The direct release program costs $185 per pet.</p>
                                    <p>There are no discounts for multiple pets. The law requires that the program be self-sustaining and paid solely by the users of quarantine.</p>
                                    <p>The U.S. Department of Defense&nbsp;may reimburse active duty military members with dogs or cats&nbsp;up to&nbsp;$550 per family for quarantine expenses. Military members should check with their command on whether this
                                        allotment is available to them.</p>

                                <p>There are several pre-shipment requirements that must be completed to qualify for the 5 Day Or Less quarantine (for more detailed information, please see the <a href="https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/files/2018/08/aqsbrochure-08.2018.pdf">Rabies Quarantine Brochure</a>)

                                        <p dir="ltr">The pet must have been administered at least two (2) rabies vaccines in its lifetime. The second vaccination must have been administered no less than 30 days after the first vaccination.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the most recent vaccination must have been given no less than 30 days, and no more than 12 months prior to arrival in Hawaii for 12-month licensed vaccines and no less than 30 days and no more than
                                            36 months prior to arrival in Hawaii for 3-year licensed vaccines;</p>

                                    <li>The pet should be microchipped for identification. The microchip is required to identify the pet with the blood sample;</li>
                                    <li>A blood sample must be sent to an approved laboratory for the OIE-Flourescent Antibody Serum Neutralization Test (OIE-FAVN), which tests for the adequate response to the rabies vaccine. A test result &gt;0.5 IU/ml is
                                        required; and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The pet must complete the required waiting period from the date the laboratory receives the blood sample before it may enter the state under the following programs:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>5 Day Or Less quarantine – requires 30-day pre-arrival waiting period.</li>

                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>If the pre-arrival requirements are not met, then the pet will not qualify for the program and must complete a more lengthy quarantine program.</p>

                                <p>If your pet arrives before the required waiting period has elapsed, your pet will not qualify for the shorter quarantine program.&nbsp; Your pet must remain in quarantine until it has completed the 120-day waiting period
                                    after passing an OIE-FAVN rabies serological test.&nbsp; Your pet must also remain in quarantine until at least 90 days has passed after the most recent rabies vaccination.&nbsp; You will be charged $14.30 for each
                                    day in quarantine, plus $244 in these situation.</p>

                                <p>The laboratories send the test results directly to the Animal Quarantine Station and to your veterinarian. In most cases, your veterinarian will have the results before the quarantine station can post it on the department’s
                                    website at: <a href="https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/ai/aqs/animal-quarantine-microchip-search/">/hdoa/organization/animal-ind/ai_aqs/microchip/</a>. The website will also indicate the earliest date your pet can enter Hawaii
                                    and qualify for the 5 Day Or Less quarantine based on the 120-day waiting period.&nbsp; Be aware that the two required rabies vaccinations must also be in compliance for a pet to qualify for the 5 Day Or Less program.</p>
                                <p>The website is updated weekly; although during peak periods or staffing shortages, the interval between updates may be as long as three or four weeks. If you are anxious to learn of the results, you may ask you veterinarian’s
                                    office to contact you when the results are received.</p>

                                <p>Honolulu is the only port of entry for all animals. All animals must arrive in Honolulu for inspection and quarantine.</p>
                                <p>Dogs and cats arriving in Honolulu will be taken from the aircraft by airline personnel and delivered to the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility. Pets are taken out of their carriers and placed in indoor kennels
                                    and provided with fresh water. Food may be provided at owner’s request.</p>
                                <p>Pets arriving during the day are transferred to the main Animal Quarantine Station in Halawa Valley on one of two van runs each day. If your pet arrives after 3:00 p.m. it will spend the night at the airport facility and
                                    will be transferred to the main Animal Quarantine Station the next morning.</p>

                                <p>Pets in transit must stay in quarantine for the duration of your stay. The airline will bring the pet from the airplane to the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility and the pet will be transferred to the main Animal
                                    Quarantine Station in Halawa Valley. Your pet will also require a health certificate issued by an accredited veterinarian within 14 days prior to arrival in Honolulu.</p>
                                <p>The cost per pet is currently $45 administrative fees, plus $14.30 per day for food and kenneling.</p>
                                <p>You may pay for the fees at the Airport office or you may go to the main Quarantine Station the day after you arrive and pay the fees by cash, VISA or MasterCard, or travelers check.</p>
                                <p>Be sure that the staff knows your departure information at least 72-hours prior to your departure so the pet can be brought back to the airport in time for your flight. Remind the airline to pick up your pet when you check
                                    in at the airport.

                                <p>The Department of Agriculture does not have any regulation regarding where pets fly within the aircraft. It is totally up to each airline’s policy. The airline is required by law to bring all incoming animals directly from

                                <p>Animals still under quarantine which are transiting from the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility to an approved outer island satellite quarantine facility or approved veterinary hospital are not permitted to fly
                                    in-cabin. If medical issues require this, special arrangements will need to be made with the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility to arrange for an inspector to accompany the animal in this instance.</p>
