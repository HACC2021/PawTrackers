                        Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility must be picked up by 10:00 a.m. or an additional $59 will be charged. &nbsp;Pet owners who are arriving in Honolulu and connecting to neighboring islands should pay particular attention

                            </strong>Pet owners are responsible for transporting all pets released from the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility (AAQHF) to their vehicles or the Interisland terminal. Airport security regulations do not permit animals
                            to be let out of the transport crate on airport property. Pets must be picked up and loaded into a vehicle or onto a baggage cart in their transport crate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, vehicles must be large enough to accommodate
                            the intact crate with the pet inside.&nbsp; There are no baggage carts or porters in the immediate vicinity of the AAQHF. &nbsp;
                            <strong>Due to limitations in inter-island service on the weekend, pets arriving on Thursday
                                or Friday may not be transferred to satellite quarantine stations and approved hospitals on the
