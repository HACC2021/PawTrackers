                <p>Inspection hours for dog and cats at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (Honolulu) are between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily, including weekends and holidays. This information is particularly important for those who are
                    qualifying their pets for direct release in Honolulu. Pet owners should be sure to arrange for their flights to arrive by 3:30 p.m. because it may take up to one hour for the airlines to transport a pet to the Airport Animal Quarantine
                    Holding Facility and animals not arriving at the facility by 4:30 p.m. will not be released at the airport that day. Pets arriving in the late afternoon and evening will be held overnight until inspections are completed the following
                    morning. Pets qualified for direct airport release that are held overnight for release in the morning at the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility must be picked up by 10:00 a.m. or an additional $59 will be charged. Pet owners
                    who are arriving in Honolulu and connecting to neighboring islands should pay particular attention to the inspection hours.</p>
